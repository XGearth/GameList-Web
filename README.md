# README

This is an attempt at creating my own Website out of Ruby on Rails.

This may or may not completely finish both aesthetically and functionally.
On the flipside, this may contain functionalities that would not make sense together.

The purpose of this is to get a hands-on experience with coding using Ruby on Rails along with any associated frameworks or languages such as Bootstrap.
